### Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on dislocation density calculations from neutron diffraction and EXAFS data analysis of borate glasses. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning scripting in Python and MATLAB.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on metals and alloys texture and residual stresses characterization.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about texture, residual stress, diffraction analysis, TEM and SEM.
